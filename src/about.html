<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
Born in 1997 and grew up in Toulouse, France. Went to the Lycée Pierre Bourdieu in Fronton to get my scientific baccalaureate.
Started the <a href="https://www.ipsa.fr/" class="extern">Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avancées</a> in 2015 and graduated as space engineer in 2020. I dream of travelling and working abroad for a space institute/observatory/company. I am currently looking for a PhD in astrophysics.
